'''
A simple TCP "echo" server written in Python.

CS 331, Fall 2025

Minimal Gopher server (RFC-style behaviour for menus and text files).
It serves files from the ./content/directory and responds with either a menu (directory listing) or a text file
Menu and text responses are terminated with a single period
To test, use the default port `localhost 48999`.
